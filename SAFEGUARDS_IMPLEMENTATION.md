# 🔒 Comprehensive Scanner Safeguards System

## Overview

This document outlines the robust safeguards system implemented to prevent orphaned scan job records and ensure proper cleanup when pausing, resuming, deleting, or starting jobs. The system provides bulletproof operation management with automatic recovery and self-healing capabilities.

**Key Consolidation**: All cleanup functionality has been consolidated into the SafeguardSystem for consistency, reliability, and maintainability. The previous `CleanupService` has been deprecated and replaced with enhanced safeguarded operations.

## 🛡️ Core Safeguard Components

### 1. **SafeguardSystem** - Central Coordination

- **Transactional Operations**: All critical operations wrapped in database transactions with rollback capability
- **Distributed Locking**: Prevents concurrent operations on same library/job
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Pre-flight and post-operation verification
- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous health checks and state validation
- **Integrated Cleanup**: All cleanup operations (scan jobs, library data) handled with full safeguards

### 2. **LockManager** - Concurrency Control

- **Library-level Locks**: Prevents concurrent scans on same library
- **Job-level Locks**: Prevents concurrent operations on same job
- **Timeout Protection**: Locks automatically timeout to prevent deadlocks
- **Distributed Safety**: Works across multiple backend instances

### 3. **TransactionManager** - Data Consistency

- **ACID Compliance**: All operations maintain database consistency
- **Automatic Rollback**: Failed operations are automatically rolled back
- **Transaction Tracking**: Active transactions monitored and managed
- **Cleanup on Failure**: Resources cleaned up if transactions fail

### 4. **HealthChecker** - System Monitoring

- **Database Connectivity**: Monitors database health
- **Stuck Job Detection**: Identifies stalled scan operations
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks system resources and performance
- **Alerting**: Notifies operators of critical issues

### 5. **WatchdogService** - Timeout Protection

- **Stall Detection**: Identifies jobs that haven't updated recently
- **Automatic Recovery**: Pauses stalled jobs for investigation
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Configurable timeout thresholds
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically fixes common issues

### 6. **StateValidator** - Consistency Checks

- **Memory vs DB Sync**: Ensures in-memory state matches database
- **Orphan Detection**: Identifies and fixes orphaned records
- **Periodic Validation**: Regular consistency checks
- **Auto-Correction**: Automatically fixes detected issues

### 7. **CleanupScheduler** - Maintenance

- **Old Job Cleanup**: Removes old completed/failed jobs
- **Orphan Removal**: Cleans up orphaned data
- **Library Cleanup**: Comprehensive library data cleanup with safeguards
- **Scheduled Maintenance**: Regular cleanup operations
- **Safeguarded Operations**: All cleanup uses transactional operations with locking

## 🚀 Enhanced API Endpoints

### Safeguarded Operations

All critical scan operations now have enhanced safeguarded versions:

- `POST /api/admin/scanner/safe/start/:id` - Start scan with safeguards
- `POST /api/admin/scanner/safe/pause/:id` - Pause scan with safeguards
- `POST /api/admin/scanner/safe/resume/:id` - Resume scan with safeguards
- `DELETE /api/admin/scanner/safe/jobs/:id` - Delete scan with safeguards

### Monitoring & Management

- `GET /api/admin/scanner/safeguards/status` - Get safeguard system status
- `POST /api/admin/scanner/emergency/cleanup` - Emergency cleanup all orphaned data

## 🔧 Configuration

### SafeguardConfig Settings

```go
type SafeguardConfig struct {
    HealthCheckInterval      time.Duration // 30s - Health check frequency
    StateValidationInterval  time.Duration // 60s - State validation frequency
    CleanupInterval         time.Duration // 5m - Cleanup frequency
    OperationTimeout        time.Duration // 30s - Max operation time
    ShutdownTimeout         time.Duration // 60s - Graceful shutdown time
    MaxRetries              int           // 3 - Max retry attempts
    RetryInterval           time.Duration // 5s - Retry delay
    OrphanedJobThreshold    time.Duration // 5m - When job considered orphaned
    OldCompletedJobRetention time.Duration // 30d - How long to keep old jobs
    EmergencyCleanupEnabled bool          // true - Allow emergency cleanup
    ForceKillTimeout       time.Duration // 10s - Force termination timeout
}
```

## 🔄 Operation Flow Examples

### Starting a Scan (Safeguarded)

```
1. Acquire library lock (prevents concurrent scans)
2. Pre-flight validation (library exists, no active scans)
3. Begin database transaction
4. Cleanup any old jobs for this library
5. Start the actual scan
6. Commit transaction
7. Post-operation validation
8. Release lock
9. Publish success event
```

### Deleting a Scan Job (Safeguarded)

```
1. Validate job exists and get library info
2. Acquire library and job locks
3. Stop scan if running (with timeout)
4. Begin database transaction
5. Cleanup scan job data (media files discovered by scan)
6. Remove scan job record
7. Commit transaction
8. Post-operation validation
9. Release locks
10. Publish success event
```

### Handling Failures

```
- If pre-flight validation fails → Return error immediately
- If scan start fails → Rollback transaction, cleanup, return error
- If transaction commit fails → Terminate scan, return error
- If post-validation fails → Log warning but don't fail operation
```

- Operation success/failure rates
- Average operation durations
- Cleanup operation statistics

### Alert Conditions

- Stalled jobs (no updates > threshold)
- Lock timeouts (potential deadlocks)
- Transaction failures (data consistency issues)
- State inconsistencies (memory vs DB mismatches)
- Emergency cleanup triggers
- Failed cleanup operations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Orphaned Jobs

**Symptoms**: Scan shows "running" but no workers/progress
**Cause**: Backend restart without proper cleanup
**Solution**: Automatic detection and cleanup by safeguards system

#### Stalled Scans

**Symptoms**: Scan stuck at same percentage for extended time
**Cause**: Scanner process crashed or hanging
**Solution**: Watchdog automatically pauses for investigation

#### Lock Timeouts

**Symptoms**: Operations fail with "timeout acquiring lock"
**Cause**: Concurrent operations or deadlock
**Solution**: Automatic timeout and retry with exponential backoff

#### State Inconsistencies

**Symptoms**: UI shows different state than actual scan
**Cause**: Race conditions or missed state updates
**Solution**: State validator automatically corrects mismatches

#### Cleanup Failures

**Symptoms**: Operations report cleanup errors
**Cause**: Database constraints or transaction conflicts
**Solution**: Automatic rollback and retry with enhanced logging

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Force Emergency Cleanup

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/scanner/emergency/cleanup
```

This performs comprehensive cleanup:

1. Cancel all active scans
2. Remove orphaned scan jobs
3. Clean up old completed jobs
4. Remove orphaned assets and files (via entity system)
5. Reset scanner state to clean baseline

### Manual Recovery Steps

1. **Check safeguard status**: `GET /api/admin/scanner/safeguards/status`
2. **Review active jobs**: `GET /api/admin/scanner/current-jobs`
3. **Force cleanup if needed**: Use emergency cleanup endpoint
4. **Restart backend** if issues persist
5. **Check logs** for specific error details
