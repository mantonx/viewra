# Media Module Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the media module to improve organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Handler Organization
- Split the monolithic `handlers.go` (506 lines) into domain-specific files:
  - `handlers.go` - Base handler struct and common functionality
  - `media_handlers.go` - Media file operations
  - `tv_handlers.go` - TV show endpoints
  - `movie_handlers.go` - Movie endpoints
  - `music_handlers.go` - Music and audio endpoints
  - `library_handlers.go` - Media library management

### 2. Shared HTTP Utilities
Created `/internal/utils/http.go` with reusable HTTP utilities:
- `ParseRangeHeader` - Parse HTTP Range headers for video streaming
- `GetMediaContentType` - Get MIME types for media containers
- `ServeFileWithRange` - Serve files with range request support
- `GetFileExtension` - Extract file extensions

### 3. Module-Specific Utilities
Utilized existing module utilities in `/internal/modules/mediamodule/utils/`:
- `probe.go` - FFprobe media file analysis

### 4. Documentation
Added comprehensive documentation to all handler methods:
- Purpose and functionality
- Request/response formats
- Query parameters
- Path parameters
- Response examples

### 5. API Endpoints Implemented

#### Media Files
- GET /api/media/files - List media files with filtering
- GET /api/media/files/:id - Get specific media file
- GET /api/media/files/:id/metadata - Get file metadata
- GET /api/media/files/:id/album-artwork - Get album artwork
- GET /api/media/files/:id/album-id - Get album ID for music files
- GET /api/media/music - Get music files
- GET /api/media/ - Search media files

#### TV Shows
- GET /api/tv/shows - List all TV shows
- GET /api/tv/shows/:id - Get specific TV show
- GET /api/tv/shows/:id/seasons - Get seasons for a show
- GET /api/tv/shows/:showId/seasons/:seasonId/episodes - Get episodes
- GET /api/tv/episodes/:episodeId - Get specific episode

#### Movies
- GET /api/movies/ - List all movies
- GET /api/movies/search - Search movies
- GET /api/movies/:id - Get specific movie
- GET /api/movies/:id/similar - Get similar movies

#### Music
- GET /api/music/artists - List all artists
- GET /api/music/artists/:id - Get specific artist
- GET /api/music/artists/:id/albums - Get artist's albums
- GET /api/music/albums - List all albums
- GET /api/music/albums/:id - Get specific album
- GET /api/music/playlists - List playlists (placeholder)
- GET /api/music/playlists/:id - Get playlist (placeholder)
- POST /api/music/playlists - Create playlist (placeholder)
- POST /api/music/playlists/:id/tracks - Add track to playlist (placeholder)

#### Libraries
- GET /api/libraries/ - List all libraries
- GET /api/libraries/:id - Get specific library
- POST /api/libraries/ - Create library
- PUT /api/libraries/:id - Update library
- DELETE /api/libraries/:id - Delete library
- POST /api/libraries/:id/scan - Trigger library scan
- GET /api/libraries/:id/scan/status - Get scan status
- POST /api/libraries/:id/metadata/refresh - Refresh metadata
- GET /api/libraries/:id/stats - Get library statistics

### 6. Database Model Compatibility
Updated handlers to work with actual database models:
- Used `MediaLibrary` instead of `Library`
- Adapted to actual field names (e.g., `Artist.Description` not `Bio`)
- Handled missing fields gracefully
- Added placeholder implementations for unimplemented features

### 7. Streaming Migration Plan
Created `STREAMING_MIGRATION.md` documenting the plan to move streaming functionality to the playback module for better separation of concerns.

## Next Steps
1. Implement streaming in the playback module
2. Remove temporary `StreamMediaFile` placeholder from media module
3. Update frontend to use new playback streaming endpoints
4. Implement playlist functionality when database schema is added
5. Add more sophisticated search and filtering capabilities

## Benefits Achieved
- **Better Organization**: Code is now organized by domain
- **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
- **Clear Documentation**: All endpoints are well-documented
- **Separation of Concerns**: Streaming will be moved to playback module
- **Reusable Utilities**: Common HTTP utilities are shared
- **Type Safety**: Fixed type mismatches with database models
