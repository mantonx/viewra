# Playback Module Streaming Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented streaming functionality in the playback module as part of the media module refactoring effort.

## Streaming Endpoints Added

### Session-Based Streaming (Recommended)
- **GET/HEAD /api/v1/playback/stream/:sessionId**
  - Streams content based on an active playback session
  - Supports direct play, remux, and transcode methods
  - Automatically updates session activity
  - Returns appropriate error for invalid sessions

### File-Based Streaming
- **GET/HEAD /api/v1/playback/stream/file/:fileId**
  - Streams a media file directly by its ID
  - Currently implements direct play only
  - TODO: Add automatic playback decision based on device

### Legacy Direct Streaming
- **GET/HEAD /api/v1/playback/stream/direct**
  - Direct streaming with path query parameter
  - Kept for backward compatibility
  - Uses progressive handler for range support

## Session Management Improvements

### Updated Routes
- Changed from `/session/*` to `/sessions/*` for REST consistency
- Added missing endpoints:
  - GET /sessions - List all active sessions
  - GET /sessions/:sessionId - Get specific session info

### Session Features
- Tracks playback method (direct, remux, transcode)
- Updates last activity on streaming requests
- Supports analytics and device tracking
- Includes debug information capability

## Implementation Details

### StreamSession Handler
```go
func (h *Handler) StreamSession(c *gin.Context)
```
- Validates session exists
- Retrieves associated media file
- Updates session activity timestamp
- Routes to appropriate streaming method:
  - Direct: Uses progressive handler
  - Remux: Placeholder for future implementation
  - Transcode: Placeholder for future implementation

### StreamFile Handler
```go
func (h *Handler) StreamFile(c *gin.Context)
```
- Simple file-based streaming by ID
- Currently only supports direct play
- Future: Add device profile detection

### Progressive Handler Integration
- Handles HTTP range requests for video seeking
- Supports partial content delivery
- Sets appropriate cache headers
- CORS support for cross-origin playback

## Media Module Changes

### Backward Compatibility
- Updated `StreamMediaFile` to redirect to playback module
- Returns HTTP 301 (Moved Permanently) 
- Preserves query parameters in redirect
- Marked for removal once clients migrate

### Redirect Path
```
OLD: /api/media/files/:id/stream
NEW: /api/v1/playback/stream/file/:id
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Media module focuses on library management
   - Playback module handles all streaming logic

2. **Session Management**
   - Centralized streaming session tracking
   - Analytics and device tracking capability
   - Activity monitoring for cleanup

3. **Scalability**
   - Ready for remux implementation
   - Ready for transcode implementation
   - Session-based architecture supports future features

4. **Compatibility**
   - Backward compatible with redirect
   - Multiple streaming approaches supported
   - Progressive migration path for clients

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. Update frontend to use new playback endpoints
2. Implement basic remux functionality
3. Add device profile auto-detection

### Medium Term
1. Implement full transcoding support
2. Add streaming quality selection
3. Implement adaptive bitrate streaming

### Long Term
1. Remove legacy media module streaming
2. Add HLS/DASH support
3. Implement streaming analytics dashboard

## Testing Endpoints

### Create Session and Stream
```bash
# 1. Create a session
POST /api/v1/playback/sessions
{
  "media_file_id": "123",
  "user_id": "user1",
  "device_id": "device1",
  "method": "direct"
}

# 2. Stream using session
GET /api/v1/playback/stream/{sessionId}
```

### Direct File Streaming
```bash
GET /api/v1/playback/stream/file/123
```

### Legacy Redirect Test
```bash
GET /api/media/files/123/stream
# Should redirect to: /api/v1/playback/stream/file/123
```
