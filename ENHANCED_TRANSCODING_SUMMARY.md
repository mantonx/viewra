# Enhanced FFmpeg Transcoding Plugin - Summary

## Overview

The FFmpeg transcoder plugin has been significantly enhanced with intelligent, content-aware transcoding capabilities. The system now automatically analyzes source content and optimizes transcoding parameters based on content type, quality, target device capabilities, and bandwidth constraints.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Content-Aware Analysis Engine

**New Component: `ContentAnalyzer`**
- Automatically analyzes video files using FFprobe
- Detects content characteristics: resolution, codec, HDR status, bitrate
- Classifies content type (movie vs TV show) and quality level (remux, webdl, standard, low)
- Determines optimal transcoding profile based on source and target parameters

**Content Classification:**
- **Movies**: Prioritize quality with slower presets and lower CRF values
- **TV Shows**: Prioritize speed with faster presets for batch processing
- **Remux Sources**: Highest quality settings with two-pass encoding
- **Web-DL Sources**: Balanced quality/speed optimization
- **Low Quality Sources**: Enable denoising and quality enhancement

### 2. Device-Specific Optimization Profiles

**Comprehensive Device Support:**

| Device | Codec Preference | HDR Support | Container | Audio |
|--------|------------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Web Modern** | HEVC, H.264 | Yes (preserve) | DASH/HLS | AAC |
| **Web Legacy** | H.264 only | No (tone map) | DASH/HLS | AAC |
| **Roku** | HEVC, H.264 | Yes (preserve) | HLS/MP4 | AC3/EAC3 passthrough |
| **NVIDIA Shield** | AV1, HEVC, H.264 | Yes (preserve) | All formats | Full passthrough |
| **Apple TV** | HEVC, H.264 | Yes (preserve) | HLS/MP4 | AC3/EAC3 passthrough |
| **Android TV** | AV1, VP9, HEVC | Yes (preserve) | DASH/HLS | Multi-codec |

### 3. Advanced HDR Processing

**HDR Preservation (Modern Devices):**
- Maintains bt2020 color space and transfer characteristics
- Preserves 10-bit pixel depth where supported
- Uses HEVC for optimal HDR compression efficiency
- Automatic detection of HDR10, Dolby Vision, and HLG content

**HDR Tone Mapping (Legacy Devices):**
- Advanced tone mapping for HDR-to-SDR conversion
- Preserves perceptual brightness and color accuracy
- Uses optimized filter chains for best quality
- Automatic fallback to H.264 for compatibility

### 4. Intelligent Quality Settings

**Content-Aware CRF Selection:**
- Base CRF values adjusted per content type and codec
- Movies: CRF reduced by 1-2 points for higher quality
- Remux content: Additional quality boost
- TV shows: Balanced settings for efficiency
- Automatic bounds checking (15-35 CRF range)

**Dynamic Preset Selection:**
- Movies + Remux: `slow` preset for maximum quality
- High quality content: `medium` preset
- Standard content: `fast` preset for good balance
- TV shows: `fast` preset for processing efficiency

### 5. Adaptive Bitrate Optimization

**Smart Bitrate Ladder:**
```
Resolution | Base Bitrate | HDR Adjustment | Movie Bonus
-----------|--------------|----------------|------------
480p       | 1.5 Mbps     | +20%          | +20%
720p       | 3.0 Mbps     | +20%          | +20%
1080p      | 6.0 Mbps     | +20%          | +20%
1440p      | 12 Mbps      | +20%          | +20%
2160p      | 25 Mbps      | +20%          | +30%
```

**Bandwidth-Aware Resolution Selection:**
- Never upscales source content
- Intelligent resolution targeting based on available bandwidth
- Mobile-optimized settings for low bandwidth scenarios
- Quality preservation for high bandwidth connections

### 6. Enhanced Audio Processing

**Content-Aware Audio Settings:**
- High-quality sources: Higher bitrate allocation
- Multi-channel audio: Proper channel mapping and bitrate scaling
- Surround sound: 5.1/7.1 optimization with appropriate bitrates
