# Comprehensive Event Coverage Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive event system implementation across the Viewra application. Events have been added for key actions throughout the system to provide real-time insights and allow for better integration with plugins and external systems.

## System Events
- **System Started**: Triggered when the backend starts up
- **System Stopped**: Triggered during graceful shutdown

## Scanner Events
- **Scan Started**: Triggered when a library scan is initiated
- **Scan Progress**: Triggered periodically during scan (every 10% or 100 files)
- **Scan Completed**: Triggered when a scan finishes successfully
- **Scan Failed**: Triggered when a scan encounters errors
- **Scan Paused**: Triggered when a scan is manually paused
- **Scan Resumed**: Triggered when a paused scan is resumed
- **Media File Found**: Triggered when a new file is discovered during scanning

## User Events
- **User Created**: Triggered when a new user account is created
- **User Logged In**: Triggered on successful login
- **User Logged Out**: Triggered when a user logs out

## Media Playback Events
- **Playback Started**: Triggered when media playback begins
- **Playback Progress**: Triggered periodically during playback (every 30 seconds)
- **Playback Finished**: Triggered when media playback completes

## Media Management Events
- **Media File Uploaded**: Triggered when a new file is uploaded
- **Media Metadata Enriched**: Available for plugin integrations

## Library Management Events
- **Media Library Created**: Triggered when a new library is added
- **Media Library Deleted**: Triggered when a library is removed

## Implementation Details
Events have been implemented across multiple components:

1. **Scanner Subsystem**:
   - Added events to the scanner manager for scan start/stop/pause/resume
   - Added events to the parallel scanner for file discovery and scan progress
   - Connected scanner operations to the event bus

2. **User Management**:
   - Created UsersHandler with event support for user creation and authentication
   - Added events for login and logout operations

3. **Media Playback**:
   - Created MusicHandler with event support for playback tracking
   - Added dedicated endpoints for tracking playback start/progress/end

4. **Media Management**:
   - Added events for media file uploads
   - Added event type for media upload operations
   - Created MediaHandler with streaming and upload event support

5. **Library Management**:
   - Created AdminHandler with event support for library operations
   - Added events for library creation and deletion

## Benefits
This comprehensive event coverage provides several advantages:

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: System administrators can see what's happening across the system
2. **Analytics**: Data can be collected about user behavior and system usage
3. **Plugin Integration**: Third-party plugins can hook into these events
4. **Diagnostics**: Easier troubleshooting with comprehensive event logs
5. **Extensibility**: New features can be built on top of the event system

## Event Types
All event types are defined in `/internal/events/types.go` and include:

- System events (system.started, system.stopped)
- Media events (media.library.scanned, media.file.found, etc.)
- User events (user.created, user.logged_in)
- Playback events (playback.started, playback.finished, playback.progress)
- Scan events (scan.started, scan.progress, scan.completed, etc.)
- General events (error, warning, info, debug)

This implementation completes the comprehensive event coverage throughout the Viewra application.
